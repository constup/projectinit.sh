== Implemented configuration

The following configuration has been implemented by ProjectInit:

* Database credentials as Docker compose secrets.
* Docker volume is used for persisting data on the host.
* Healthcheck is implemented directly in the Docker image (custom Dockerfile).
* Custom `my.cnf` MySQL configuration file and directory are prepared.
* Default authentication is set to non-deprecated `caching_sha2_password` method for both MySQL daemon and client.
* Percona telemetry is disabled.

=== Configuration files

=== Database credentials

Database credentials are stored as Docker Compose secrets. The secrets are available in
link:../../compose_secrets[`compose_secrets`] directory of your project.

=== Persisting data on the host

Docker volume is used for persisting data on the host. This is the default method recommended in the documentation of
the official Docker image. Volume file and directory permissions are managed by Docker. You are free to mount a local
directory instead (bind mount), however, you will need to set up the directory, its owner (user), permissions and other
security mechanisms yourself.

* link:https://docs.docker.com/engine/storage/volumes/[Docker Volumes]
* link:https://docs.docker.com/engine/storage/bind-mounts/[Docker bind mounts]

=== Healthcheck

Basic healthcheck mechanism has been implemented in the custom Dockerfile. It makes sure that the database service is up
before allowing your application to run.

* link:https://docs.docker.com/reference/dockerfile/#healthcheck[Healthcheck in Dockerfile]

=== Custom MySQL configuration

Custom MySQL configuration directory is implemented and ready in
link:../../projectinit_docker/dev/percona/etc/my.cnf.d/[`projectinit_docker/dev/percona/etc/my.cnf.d/`] and
link:../../projectinit_docker/prod/percona/etc/my.cnf.d/[`projectinit_docker/prod/percona/etc/my.cnf.d/`]. `*.cnf` files in
this directory will be added to the container when you build it.

You can also use already added `my.cnf` file.

==== Default authentication methods

Default authentication methods for MySQL daemon and the Client are set to `caching_sha2_password` in the above-mentioned
`my.cnf` custom configuration file.

By default, Percona sets deprecated `sha256_password` and `mysql_native_password` as authentication methods for the
daemon and the client, which ends up filling logs with deprecation warnings.
