== Implemented configuration

The following configuration has been implemented by ProjectInit:

* Database credentials as Docker compose secrets.
* Docker volume is used for persisting data on the host.
* Healthcheck is implemented directly in the Docker image (custom Dockerfile).
* Custom `mongod.conf` MongoDB configuration file is prepared.
* Bind mount of database initialization directory

=== Configuration files

* Database credentials (Docker Compose secrets):
** link:../../compose_secrets/mongodb_database.txt[`compose_secrets/mongodb_database.txt`]
** link:../../compose_secrets/mongodb_root_password.txt[`compose_secrets/mongodb_root_password.txt`]
** link:../../compose_secrets/mongodb_root_user.txt[`compose_secrets/mongodb_root_user.txt`]
* Dockerfile:
** link:../../projectinit_docker/dev/mongodb/Dockerfile[`projectinit_docker/dev/mongodb/Dockerfile`]
** link:../../projectinit_docker/prod/mongodb/Dockerfile[`projectinit_docker/prod/mongodb/Dockerfile`]
* Entry point:
** link:../../projectinit_docker/dev/mongodb/usr/local/bin/entrypoint.sh[`projectinit_docker/dev/mongodb/usr/local/bin/entrypoint.sh`]
** link:../../projectinit_docker/prod/mongodb/usr/local/bin/entrypoint.sh[`projectinit_docker/prod/mongodb/usr/local/bin/entrypoint.sh`]
* Custom MongoDB configuration file:
** link:../../projectinit_docker/dev/mongodb/etc/mongod.conf[`projectinit_docker/dev/mongodb/etc/mongod.conf`]
** link:../../projectinit_docker/prod/mongodb/etc/mongod.conf[`projectinit_docker/prod/mongodb/etc/mongod.conf`]
* Database initialization directory:
** link:../../projectinit_docker/dev/mongodb/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d[`projectinit_docker/dev/mongodb/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d`]
** link:../../projectinit_docker/prod/mongodb/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d[`projectinit_docker/prod/mongodb/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d`]

=== Database credentials

Database credentials are stored as Docker Compose secrets. The secrets are available in
link:../../compose_secrets[`compose_secrets`] directory of your project.

=== Persisting data on the host

Docker volume is used for persisting data on the host. This is the default method recommended in the documentation of
the official Docker image. Volume file and directory permissions are managed by Docker. You are free to mount a local
directory instead (bind mount), however, you will need to set up the directory, its owner (user), permissions and other
security mechanisms yourself.

Resources:

* link:https://docs.docker.com/engine/storage/volumes/[Docker Volumes]
* link:https://docs.docker.com/engine/storage/bind-mounts/[Docker bind mounts]

=== Healthcheck

Basic healthcheck mechanism has been implemented in the custom Dockerfile. It makes sure that the database service is up
before allowing your application to run.

Resources:

* link:https://docs.docker.com/reference/dockerfile/#healthcheck[Healthcheck in Dockerfile]

=== Custom MongoDB configuration

Custom MongoDB configuration file is implemented and ready in
link:../../projectinit_docker/dev/mongodb/etc/mongod.conf[`projectinit_docker/dev/mongodb/etc/mongod.conf`] and
link:../../projectinit_docker/prod/mongodb/etc/mongod.conf[`projectinit_docker/prod/mongodb/etc/mongod.conf`].

Note that MongoDB Docker images do not have default configuration file, like MySQL and its forks do. What's configured
in this custom configuration file will be the only configuration applied.

== Database initialization directory

When a container is started for the first time it will execute files with extensions `.sh` and `.js` that are found in
`/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d`. Files will be executed in alphabetical order. `.js` files will be executed by `mongosh`
(`mongo` on versions below 6) using the database specified by the `MONGO_INITDB_DATABASE` variable, if it is present,
or `test` otherwise. You may also switch databases within the `.js` script.

A bind mount of this container directory is available at:

** link:../../projectinit_docker/dev/mongodb/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d[`projectinit_docker/dev/mongodb/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d`]
** link:../../projectinit_docker/prod/mongodb/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d[`projectinit_docker/prod/mongodb/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d`]
