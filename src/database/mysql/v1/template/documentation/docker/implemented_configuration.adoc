== Implemented configuration

The following configuration has been implemented by ProjectInit:

* Database credentials as Docker compose secrets.
* Docker volume is used for persisting data on the host.
* Healthcheck is implemented directly in the Docker image (custom Dockerfile).
* Custom `my.cnf` MySQL configuration file and directory are prepared.
* Bind mount of database initialization directory

=== Configuration files

** link:../../compose_secrets/mysql_password.txt[`compose_secrets/mysql_password.txt`]
** link:../../compose_secrets/mysql_root_password.txt[`compose_secrets/mysql_root_password.txt`]
** link:../../compose_secrets/mysql_user.txt[`compose_secrets/mysql_user.txt`]
* Dockerfile:

** link:../../projectinit_docker/prod/mysql/Dockerfile[`projectinit_docker/prod/mysql/Dockerfile`]
* Entry point:
** link:../../projectinit_docker/dev/mysql/entrypoint.sh[`projectinit_docker/dev/mysql/entrypoint.sh`]
** link:../../projectinit_docker/prod/mysql/entrypoint.sh[`projectinit_docker/prod/mysql/entrypoint.sh`]
* Custom MySQL configuration directory:

** link:../../projectinit_docker/prod/mysql/etc/mysql/conf.d/[`projectinit_docker/prod/mysql/etc/mysql/conf.d/`]
* Custom MySQL configuration file:
** link:../../projectinit_docker/dev/mysql/etc/mysql/conf.d/my.cnf[`projectinit_docker/dev/mysql/etc/mysql/conf.d/my.cnf`]
** link:../../projectinit_docker/prod/mysql/etc/mysql/conf.d/my.cnf[`projectinit_docker/prod/mysql/etc/mysql/conf.d/my.cnf`]
* Database initialization directory:
** link:../../projectinit_docker/dev/mysql/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d[`projectinit_docker/dev/mysql/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d`]
** link:../../projectinit_docker/prod/mysql/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d[`projectinit_docker/prod/mysql/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d`]

=== Database credentials

Database credentials are stored as Docker Compose secrets. The secrets are available in
link:../../compose_secrets[`compose_secrets`] directory of your project.

Resources:

* link:https://docs.docker.com/compose/how-tos/use-secrets/[How to use secrets in Docker Compose]

=== Persisting data on the host

Docker volume is used for persisting data on the host. This is the default method recommended in the documentation of
the official Docker image. Volume file and directory permissions are managed by Docker. You are free to mount a local
directory instead (bind mount), however, you will need to set up the directory, its owner (user), permissions and other
security mechanisms yourself.

Resources:

* link:https://docs.docker.com/engine/storage/volumes/[Docker Volumes]
* link:https://docs.docker.com/engine/storage/bind-mounts/[Docker bind mounts]

=== Healthcheck

Basic healthcheck mechanism has been implemented in the custom Dockerfile. It makes sure that the database service is up
before allowing your application to run.

Resources:

* link:https://docs.docker.com/reference/dockerfile/#healthcheck[Healthcheck in Dockerfile]

=== Custom MySQL configuration

Custom MySQL configuration directory is implemented and ready in
link:../../projectinit_docker/dev/mysql/etc/mysql/conf.d/[`projectinit_docker/dev/mysql/etc/mysql/conf.d/`] and
link:../../projectinit_docker/prod/mysql/etc/mysql/conf.d/[`projectinit_docker/prod/mysql/etc/mysql/conf.d/`]. `*.cnf` files in
this directory will be added to the container when you build it.

You can also use already added `my.cnf` file.

== Database initialization directory

When a container is started for the first time, a new database with the specified name will be created and initialized
with the provided configuration variables. Furthermore, it will execute files with extensions `.sh`, `.sql` and
`.sql.gz` that are found in `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d`.

A bind mount of this container directory is available at:

** link:../../projectinit_docker/dev/mysql/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d[`projectinit_docker/dev/mysql/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d`]
** link:../../projectinit_docker/prod/mysql/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d[`projectinit_docker/prod/mysql/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d`]
