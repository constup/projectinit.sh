== Implemented configuration

The following configuration has been implemented by ProjectInit:

* Database credentials as Docker compose secrets.
* Docker volume is used for persisting data on the host.
* Healthcheck is implemented directly in the Docker image (custom Dockerfile).

=== Configuration files

* Database credentials (Docker Compose secrets):
** link:../../compose_secrets/postgres_db.txt[`compose_secrets/postgres_db.txt`]
** link:../../compose_secrets/postgres_password.txt[`compose_secrets/postgres_password.txt`]
** link:../../compose_secrets/postgres_user.txt[`compose_secrets/postgres_user.txt`]
* Dockerfile:
** link:../../projectinit_docker/dev/pgsql/Dockerfile[`projectinit_docker/dev/pgsql/Dockerfile`]
** link:../../projectinit_docker/prod/pgsql/Dockerfile[`projectinit_docker/prod/pgsql/Dockerfile`]

=== Database credentials

Database credentials are stored as Docker Compose secrets. The secrets are available in
link:../../compose_secrets[`compose_secrets`] directory of your project.

=== Persisting data on the host

Docker volume is used for persisting data on the host. This is the default method recommended in the documentation of
the official Docker image. Volume file and directory permissions are managed by Docker. You are free to mount a local
directory instead (bind mount), however, you will need to set up the directory, its owner (user), permissions and other
security mechanisms yourself.

=== Healthcheck

Basic healthcheck mechanism has been implemented in the custom Dockerfile. It makes sure that the database service is up
before allowing your application to run.
