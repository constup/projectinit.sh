== Description

Interactive Bash tool for kickstarting software projects. No additional software or abstraction layers. ProjectInit is
made to just automate creating libraries, projects and environments the same way you would do manually.

Set up a containerized or local (bare metal) environment for developing applications or libraries in just a couple of
guided prompts.

Supports multiple programming languages and frameworks. Whether it's a npm package, composer library, NestJS or Symfony
application, ProjectInit got it covered.

== Key features

* Written in POSIX compliant Bash. Available on Linux, Windows and MacOS.
* Create new or continue working on the existing projects, whether it's a full application or a library
* Set up a project using locally installed tools (languages, package managers,...) or containers (Docker)
* Containerized projects with zero dependencies (except for Docker or Podman).
* Support for multiple languages, frameworks and types of libraries
* No additional abstraction layer. Projects created with ProjectInit are raw, just like you've set up them yourself
manually
* No bloatware

== Prerequisites

* Bash
** *Linux* - Bash should be available by default. If it's not, consult your distro's documentation to see how to
install it.
** *Windows* - Any terminal emulator that supports Bash will do (link:https://cmder.app/[Cmder],
link:https://conemu.github.io/[ConEmu], link:https://www.mingw-w64.org/[mingw-w64],...)
** *MacOS* - MacOS uses zsh as the default shell. You will have to set up Bash. Consult MacOS documentation or online
resources to see how to do that.
* When using ProjectInit with *locally installed* languages and tools:
** Depending on what you are setting up, some dependencies will be required, most notably a correct language version of
the programming language that you want to work on
** Other dependencies might be required. ProjectInit will check these dependencies and let you know if anything is
missing.
* When running ProjectInit to create *containerized projects*:
** Docker.
** No other dependencies required.
