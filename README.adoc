= ProjectInit.sh
:toc:
:toclevels: 5

Interactive bash tool for kickstarting software projects.

== OS support

*Note*: Depending on what each tool in ProjectInit.sh is supposed to do, you may need additional software installed,
but nothing which you probably don't already have in your development environment.

* *Linux*: Bash is the most common shell on any Linux distro, so ProjectInit.sh is supported as well.

* *Windows*: Supported in terminal emulators and environments that can run Bash (https://cmder.app/[Cmder],
https://conemu.github.io/[ConEmu], https://www.mingw-w64.org/[Mingw],â€¦). During development,
ProjectInit.sh is tested on https://cmder.app/[Cmder] with additional Linux tools installed with
https://scoop.sh/[Scoop] (for example: `wget`).

* *MacOS*: Since _zsh_ is default terminal, you will need to have Bash installed.

If you need help installing bash or any other prerequisites, take a look at the link:./doc/PREREQUISITES.md[Prerequisites]
documentation page.
