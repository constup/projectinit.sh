== Introduction

These rules and guidelines will help and guide you when implementing features and working on ProjectInit.sh development.

The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
"OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in link:https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt[RFC 2119].

== General user experience

. All questions the user should answer when running ProjectInit MUST be asked before any changes to the filesystem are
made.

== Prompts

. All "yes/no" prompts MUST implement the following acceptable input:
- for "yes": `"y"|"yes"|"yup"|"yeah"|"1"`
- for "no": `"n"|"no"|"nope"|"2"`
