= Integrations
:toc:
:toclevels: 5

Integrations are optional. You can use scripts from a terminal. However, you can integrate scripts into other tools
(like IDEs and editors).

== JetBrains IDEs

=== Windows

You must have bash Windows executable. `bash.exe` can be found, for example, in Git for Windows or Cmder.

Each `.sh` file in `./bin/` directory can be integrated as a separate External Tool in the IDE.

Open IDE's settings (`Ctrl+Alt+s`), go to `Tools > External Tools` and add an external tool for the desired script
with the following parameters:

* `Program` - Full path of `bash.exe` on your Windows machine;
* `Arguments` - Full path to the bash script;
* `Working directory` - `$ProjectFileDir$`
* Check the `Make console active on message in stdout` and `Make console active on message in stderr` checkboxes.

Additionally, you can set the `Group` parameter of the external tool to a group of your choice. If a group with the
desired name doesn't exist, you can just type it in, and it will be created automatically. Otherwise, select the group
from the dropdown.
